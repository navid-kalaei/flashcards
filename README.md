# UdaciFlashcard
A fantastic flashcards app powered by React Native!

# About:
#### This is the last project of [the Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) powered by [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [React Native Elements](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements) that make you able to create decks of cards and test your self and get a score
If you want to be lazy this app won't suite you because it sends notifications if you don't take a quizz each day!
However if your a programmer, go ahead and help your self! You'll get familiar with react native and some cool features I've provided ones you start reading the code. :sunglasses:
